This is our game project for object-oriented programming at HCMIU in semester 2 (2022 - 2023). This is a classic game based on Platform game which is very popular among people all over the world. We have edited them in a classic style with the main character being a hero who is on the way to find and defeat the dark knight. On the way, the hero encountered many difficulties such as killing monsters and traps. We hope that you will enjoy our game project
